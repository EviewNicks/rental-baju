# TSK-24: Multi-Condition Item Return System Enhancement

## 📋 Overview
Enhance the clothing return system to support multiple conditions for items with quantity > 1, addressing the **CRITICAL DESIGN GAP** where the current system cannot handle real-world scenarios where different units of the same item are returned in different conditions.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

### Current System Limitation
**CRITICAL ISSUE**: The return system currently forces all quantities of an item into a single condition, preventing accurate penalty calculation and inventory tracking for mixed-condition scenarios.

**Business Impact Example**:
- **Item**: "Gaun Pesta" (quantity: 3, all taken by customer)
- **Real Return Scenario**: 1 item lost, 2 items in good condition
- **Current System Problem**: Must choose either "All 3 lost" (penalty: 450K) OR "All 3 good" (no penalty)
- **Required Solution**: Split handling - 1 lost (150K penalty) + 2 good (0K penalty) = Total: 150K penalty

## 👤 Enhanced User Story

**As a cashier**, I want to process returns where different quantities of the same item have different conditions, so I can calculate accurate penalties and maintain proper inventory tracking that reflects real-world rental scenarios.

**Business Scenarios**:
- Process items returned with mixed conditions (some damaged, some good)
- Calculate fair penalties based on actual item conditions
- Track inventory accurately by condition type
- Maintain audit trail for each condition decision

## 🔄 Enhanced User Flow

```
START → Search Transaction → Validate Eligibility → For Each Item:
  → Single Item? → Use existing simple interface
  → Multiple Items? → Show enhanced multi-condition interface:
    → Add condition splits (condition + quantity)
    → Validate total quantities
    → Calculate mixed penalties
→ Review penalty breakdown → Confirm return → Process atomically → END
```

## ✅ Enhanced Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- **Multi-Condition Support**: Process items with quantity > 1 using different conditions per unit
- **Quantity Validation**: Ensure returned quantities don't exceed taken quantities
- **Mixed Penalty Calculation**: Calculate accurate penalties for each condition split

  kondisiAkhir VARCHAR(500),
  jumlahKembali INTEGER,
  penaltyAmount DECIMAL(10,2),

**Estimated Timeline**: 10 days  
**Story Points**: 13 points (complex multi-condition architecture enhancement)  
**Actual Implementation**: 1 day (Phase 1 Backend Foundation)
**Team**: Backend Developer, Frontend Developer, QA Engineer, Database Administrator  
**Critical Dependencies**: TSK-23 completion ✅, Database Migration approval ✅  
**Related Stories**: TSK-21 (Transaction Management), TSK-22 (Pengambilan System), TSK-23 (Return System Base)

This enhancement transforms the return system from a single-condition limitation to a flexible multi-condition solution that accurately reflects real-world rental business scenarios while maintaining system stability and user experience.

## 🔄 Migration Strategy

### Phased Rollout Approach
1. **Non-Breaking Database Migration**: Add new capabilities without affecting existing functionality
2. **Dual-Mode Backend**: Support both simple and multi-condition processing simultaneously  
3. **Progressive UI Enhancement**: Gradually introduce enhanced interface with feature flags
4. **Gradual User Adoption**: Roll out to admin users first, then all kasir users with training

This approach ensures zero downtime and smooth transition to the enhanced multi-condition return system while maintaining business continuity throughout the implementation process.
