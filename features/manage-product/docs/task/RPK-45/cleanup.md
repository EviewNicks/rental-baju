      expectedResult: 'Material created, price tracked, products updated'
    },
    {
      name: 'Material deactivation impact',
      steps: [
        'Create material and link to product type',
        'Deactivate material',
        'Attempt to create new product type with inactive material',
        'Verify existing product types still functional'
      ],
      expectedResult: 'New creation blocked, existing maintained'
    }
  ];
});
```

#### Cost Calculation Accuracy
```typescript
describe('Cost Calculation Validation', () => {

    {
      scenario: 'Basic calculation',
      material: { pricePerUnit: 15000, unit: 'meter' },
      productType: { processingCost: 5000, laborCost: 2000 },
      quantity: 2,
      expectedModalAwal: 37000, // (15000 * 2) + 5000 + 2000
    },
    {
      scenario: 'Decimal precision',
      material: { pricePerUnit: 12.50, unit: 'piece' },
      productType: { processingCost: 7.25, laborCost: 0 },
      quantity: 3,
      expectedModalAwal: 44.75, // (12.50 * 3) + 7.25
    },
    {
      scenario: 'Bulk quantity',
      material: { pricePerUnit: 8000, unit: 'meter' },
      productType: { processingCost: 10000, laborCost: 5000 },
