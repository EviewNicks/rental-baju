# TSK-24 Design Documents Archive

**Archive Date**: August 11, 2025  
**Reason**: Design consolidation - multiple design documents replaced with single comprehensive specification

---

## üìã **Archive Contents**

### **design-original.md** (Archived)
- **Original Filename**: `design.md`
- **Created**: 2025-08-07  
- **Approach**: Dual-mode architecture (single-mode + multi-mode)
- **Status**: **Not Implemented** - Design approach was revised before implementation
- **Key Features**: 
  - Enhanced backward compatibility through dual processing
  - Progressive enhancement with mode detection
  - Complex architecture with multiple processing paths

### **design-delete-single-mode.md** (Archived)  
- **Original Filename**: `design-delete-single-mode.md`
- **Created**: 2025-08-09
- **Approach**: Unified multi-condition architecture  
- **Status**: **Implemented** - This approach was actually implemented
- **Key Features**:
  - Complete elimination of single-mode processing
  - Unified multi-condition architecture for all scenarios
  - Simplified architecture through complete unification

## üéØ **Archive Rationale**

### **Why These Documents Were Archived**

**Problem**: Multiple design documents created confusion about the actual implemented system:
- `design.md` described dual-mode approach that was never implemented
- `design-delete-single-mode.md` described unified approach that was implemented  
- No single source of truth for the actual system design

**Solution**: Consolidated into **`design-final.md`** which:
- Reflects the actual implemented unified architecture
- Incorporates all implementation results and bug fixes
- Documents the current production system accurately
- Serves as the definitive design specification

### **Implementation History**

**Timeline**:
1. **design.md** - Initial dual-mode design concept
2. **design-delete-single-mode.md** - Revised unified design concept  
3. **Implementation** - Backend Phase 1 (Aug 10) + Frontend Phase 2 (Aug 10-11)
4. **Bug Fixes** - Critical penalty calculator sync (Aug 11)
5. **design-final.md** - Consolidated final specification (Aug 11)

**Result**: Unified multi-condition architecture successfully implemented with:
- ‚úÖ Backend unification completed  
- ‚úÖ Frontend unification completed
- ‚úÖ Critical bugs resolved (RPK-42)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive testing and documentation

## üîç **Archive Access**

### **Current System Documentation**
- **Active Design**: `../design-final.md` - Definitive design specification
- **Current Analysis**: `../../analyze.md` - Current system state analysis
- **Implementation Details**: `../be-TSK-24.md`, `../fe-RPK-24.md` - Implementation records

### **Archive Purpose**
These documents are preserved for:
- **Historical Reference** - Understanding design evolution
- **Research Value** - Studying alternative architectural approaches
- **Educational Use** - Learning from design iteration process
- **Audit Trail** - Complete record of design decisions and rationale

---

**Archive Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**  
**Replacement Document**: `design-final.md` (Single comprehensive specification)  
**Archive Maintenance**: Documents preserved as read-only historical reference  
**Next Review**: Archive review not required - documents serve as permanent historical record
