# TSK-24: Multi-Condition Item Return System Enhancement

## 📋 Overview
Enhance the clothing return system to support multiple conditions for items with quantity > 1, addressing the **CRITICAL DESIGN GAP** where the current system cannot handle real-world scenarios where different units of the same item are returned in different conditions.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

### Current System Limitation
**CRITICAL ISSUE**: The return system currently forces all quantities of an item into a single condition, preventing accurate penalty calculation and inventory tracking for mixed-condition scenarios.

**Business Impact Example**:
- **Item**: "Gaun Pesta" (quantity: 3, all taken by customer)
- **Real Return Scenario**: 1 item lost, 2 items in good condition
- **Current System Problem**: Must choose either "All 3 lost" (penalty: 450K) OR "All 3 good" (no penalty)
- **Required Solution**: Split handling - 1 lost (150K penalty) + 2 good (0K penalty) = Total: 150K penalty

## 👤 Enhanced User Story

**As a cashier**, I want to process returns where different quantities of the same item have different conditions, so I can calculate accurate penalties and maintain proper inventory tracking that reflects real-world rental scenarios.

**Business Scenarios**:
- Process items returned with mixed conditions (some damaged, some good)
- Calculate fair penalties based on actual item conditions
- Track inventory accurately by condition type
- Maintain audit trail for each condition decision

## 🔄 Enhanced User Flow

```
START → Search Transaction → Validate Eligibility → For Each Item:
  → Single Item? → Use existing simple interface
  → Multiple Items? → Show enhanced multi-condition interface:
    → Add condition splits (condition + quantity)
    → Validate total quantities
    → Calculate mixed penalties
→ Review penalty breakdown → Confirm return → Process atomically → END
```

## ✅ Enhanced Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- **Multi-Condition Support**: Process items with quantity > 1 using different conditions per unit
- **Quantity Validation**: Ensure returned quantities don't exceed taken quantities
- **Mixed Penalty Calculation**: Calculate accurate penalties for each condition split
- **Inventory Accuracy**: Update product availability based on actual returned quantities
