### Code Quality: 85% 

**Positive Indicators:**
- No `any` types in core implementation
- Comprehensive error handling in API routes
- Proper async/await patterns
- Clean component composition
- Following React hooks best practices

**Quality Issues:**
- Type hack in MaterialManagement.tsx line 149: `category={selectedMaterial as any}`
- Inconsistent loading state management across components
- Missing React Error Boundaries

### Performance: 80% 

**Optimization Achievements:**
- React Query with 5-minute stale time optimization
- Proper cache invalidation patterns
- API endpoint efficiency
- TypeScript compilation performance

**Performance Gaps:**

## Gap Analysis

### Critical Gaps =4

#### 1. Type Safety Issue
**Location**: `features/manage-product/components/material/MaterialManagement.tsx:149`
```typescript
// PROBLEM: Type hack to reuse existing dialog
category={selectedMaterial as any}
```
**Impact**: Type safety compromise, maintenance risk
**Fix Required**: Create proper MaterialDeleteDialog component

#### 2. Missing E2E Testing
**Gap**: No Playwright tests for Material workflows
**Impact**: User experience not validated end-to-end
**Coverage**: Material CRUD, tab navigation, Product integration workflows

#### 3. No Error Boundaries
**Gap**: Missing React Error Boundaries around Material components
**Impact**: Component crashes could affect entire application
**Risk**: Production stability issues

### Important Gaps =á

#### 4. Search Performance
**Gap**: No debouncing in MaterialList search functionality
**Impact**: Excessive API calls on every keystroke
**User Experience**: Poor performance during search

#### 5. Mobile Responsiveness
**Gap**: Mobile UI not validated for MaterialList and MaterialForm
**Impact**: Mobile user experience uncertain
**Business Risk**: Tablet/mobile usage not tested

#### 6. Integration Testing
**Gap**: No tests between API routes and service layer
**Impact**: Integration reliability uncertain
**Coverage**: React Query hooks with actual API calls
